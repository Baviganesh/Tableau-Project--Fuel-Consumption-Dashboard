# Tableau-Project--Fuel-Consumption-Dashboard

A Fuel Consumption Dashboard is a visualization tool that provides insights into the fuel usage patterns of a fleet of vehicles or a single vehicle over a specific period. This dashboard is particularly useful for fleet managers, logistics coordinators, and vehicle operators who want to monitor fuel efficiency, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to optimize fuel consumption.
